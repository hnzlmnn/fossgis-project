\section{Conclusion}

Our research showed that for visualizations of the intra-urban heat island effect using densely distributed measurement stations the most accurate interpolation method to be IDW. However, if the result should give a smooth picture the Spline interpolation also gives fairly accurate results. Especially if there are clusters of measurement points, IDW should be the preferred interpolation method.

Throughout our analysis we did only encounter small differences at the Voronoi diagram edges between the used FOSSGIS implementations (most likely due to differences in neighbor selection). Thus, we recommend using the tool that fits best in the existing process.
